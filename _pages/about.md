I’m Sarah — a scientist driven by a deep curiosity about how materials behave, transform, and grow.

My research journey began with the development of nanomaterials and thin films for sensing applications at a national research institute. That early hands-on work with functional materials sparked a lasting fascination with how structure and form can be designed with purpose.

Since then, my work has spanned multiple scales and material states — from studying high-pressure crystalline behavior to synthesizing and characterizing magnetic colloids throughout my graduate career.

Today, my focus is on living materials made with and from fungi. I explore how the architecture of the natural world can be combined with synthetic design to create biohybrid systems. At the heart of my research is the belief that when we understand both systems and structure, we can create materials that are not just smart — but alive.

Whether you're working in soft matter, sustainable design, or biofabrication, I’m always open to connecting and exchanging ideas.
