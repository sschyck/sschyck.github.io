  abstract = {By irradiating a pressurized mixture of a fluorine-bearing compound (\$XeF\_2\$) and \$HgF\_2\$ with synchrotron hard x-rays (\&gt;7 keV) inside a diamond anvil cell, we have observed dramatic changes in the far-infrared spectrum within the 30-35 GPa pressure range which suggest that we may have formed \$HgF\_4\$ in the following way: \$XeF\_2 {\textbackslash}xrightarrow\{hv\} Xe + F\_2\$ (photochemically) and \$HgF\_2 + F\_2 {\textbackslash}rightarrow HgF\_4\$ (30 GPa \&lt; P \&lt; 35 GPa). This lends credence to recent theoretical calculations by Botana et al. that suggest that Hg may behave as a transition metal at high pressure in an environment with an excess of molecular fluorine. The spectral changes were observed to be reversible during pressure cycling above and below the above mentioned pressure range until a certain point when we suspect that molecular fluorine diffused out of the sample at lower pressure. Upon pressure release, \$HgF\_2\$ and trace \$XeF\_2\$ were observed to be remaining in the sample chamber suggesting that much of the \$Xe\$ and \$F\_2\$ diffused and leaked out from the sample chamber. \&nbsp; Received: 29 October 2018,\&nbsp; Accepted: 18 January 2019;\&nbsp;Edited by: A.

It also introduces innovative methods for crafting anisotropic composite magnetic microparticles. The first half of the thesis focuses on self-assembling colloidal superballs, revealing arrangements through small-angle x-ray scattering during droplet evaporation. Incorporating permanent magnetic superballs adds complexity, unveiling dipole-induced structures. Magnetic field effects on assembly are also observed, offering insights into tunable macroscopic colloidal assembly formation. Furthermore, the work aims to improve photocatalytic hematite microparticles, essential for applications like self-propelled motion. Here, calcination substantially heightens their activity. Lastly, diverse techniques for crafting anisotropic composite magnetic microparticles are explored, concluding with future prospects in this dynamic field of soft matter.},

By employing evaporation assisted self-assembly, we form opal-like structures with micro-sized magnetic superball particles. We study the structure formation of different superball shapes during evaporation of a dispersion droplet with in-situ small angle x-ray scattering with microradian resolution in the absence and presence of an external magnetic field. In the absence of a magnetic field, strong shape-dependent structures form as the water evaporates from the system. Applying a magnetic field to the droplet has a unique effect on the system; strong magnetic fields inhibit the growth of well-ordered assemblies due to the formation of out-of-equilibrium dipolar structures while lower magnetic fields allow particles to rearrange and orient without inhibition. In this work, we show how the superball assembly inside a droplet can be controlled by the magnetic field strength and the superball shape. The tunability of these parameters not only enables the controllable formation of macroscopic colloidal assemblies but also opens up possibilities for the development of functional materials with tailored properties on a macro-scale.},

In this regard, colloidal superballs are unique building blocks because their shape can smoothly transition between spherical and cubic. Assembly of colloidal superballs under spherical confinement results in macroscopic clusters with ordered internal structure. By utilizing Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS), we probe the internal structure of colloidal superball dispersion droplets during confinement. We observe and identify four distinct drying regimes that arise during compression via evaporating droplets, and we track the development of the assembled macrostructure. As the superballs assemble, we found that they arrange into the predicted paracrystalline, rhombohedral C1-lattice that varies by the constituent superballs' shape. This provides insights in the behavior between confinement and particle shape that can be applied in the development of new functional materials.},

  abstract = {It has been theoretically predicted that when mercury difluoride (HgF2) is pressurized to above 50 GPa in the presence of molecular fluorine, it will most likely transform into mercury tetrafluoride (HgF4), thus mercury will behave as a transition element at high pressure. However, there is no experimental evidence verifying this prediction yet. To begin with, the crystalline properties of pure HgF2 at high pressure were not experimentally established. In this thesis, the high pressure structural properties of HgF2 are investigated by means of synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction. Our results reveal that the predicted, ambient cubic structure of HgF2 with the space group Fm3m, can be obtained via a high-pressure ramp purification process using powdered HgF2 mixed with crystalline XeF2 which serves as our molecular fluorine source. The structural transformation of purified HgF2 is observed above 2.5 GPa, and by using first-principle calculations, two candidate structures with space groups Pnma and Pnam are proposed which persist up to 63 GPa. Furthermore, studies of HgF2 in the presence of F2 produced by the X-ray induced decomposition of XeF2 up to 70 GPa are reviewed. The obtained results provide more insights into the highpressure behavior of mercury-fluorine compounds and will benefit further experimental investigation of high pressure induced synthesis of HgF4.},
